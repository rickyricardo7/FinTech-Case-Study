``Ricardo C.``

## Overview and Origin
* JP Morgan chase was founded on December 1, 2000 and the founder is John Pierpont Morgan.
* JPM Coin, a digital coin, ran by JP Morgan Chase.
*  JPM Coin is using their technology to their advantage by instantly allowing customers send US Dollars to other customers simply through their phones. They came up with this idea because they do not want to be irrelevant and being "Amazon-ed" quoted from "JPM Coin Case Study Proposal.pdf".
* The competitors would be Libra, and TON. 

## Business Activities
* The challenges that JPM Coin is trying to solve are the ways to send payments across borders, and making it more efficient moving the customers money with the new upcoming generation services.
* The intended customers for JPM Coin would be JPMorgan's clients as of right now; and in the long run, they intend to add other currencies and potentially be available for individual customers.
* The technologies that JPM Coin are mainly using is blockchain, and they are using Quorum, in which Quorum is built on Ethereum which supports smart contracts.

## Landscape
* The domain of the financial industry for JPM Coin would be under Cryptocurrencies.
* Major trends have been the fast growing on the finance and technology, and how all of the new innovations have sped a lot of things up over the last 5-10 years.
* The well known companies who are part of this domain would be Bitcoin, Libra, TON, Coinbase, Square.

## Results
* The impact the business is taking, is that it is growing to new things, the JPM Coin alone is what is most impactful, it is showing the major companies to value of crypto and the value of blockchain
* Some of the core metrics that the companies are using to measure success would be public interest and transactions, and Gateway Enterprise Metrics.
* The company is the top performer with the asset turnaround beating Bitcoin.

## Recommendations
* What I would suggest for JPM Coin is to offer their service not only to their customers but to everyone internationally, this can benefit JP Morgan because it would make it bigger, and beat their competitors with their new growing idea, the technologies that they would have to be using are the same ones that they are using right now which is blockchain, it would be the appropriate way to keep growing JPM Coin and especially while using Quorum.
